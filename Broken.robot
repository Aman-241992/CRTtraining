*** Test Cases ***

# Tip: Test cases start from here. The structure of a test case is as follows:
#      Name of the test
#          [Documentation]    A short explanation of the test.
#          Test steps
#
#      A new test case starts from the beginning of the line. Each test step starts with four
#      spaces, followed by a QWord, at least four spaces, and its arguments.

# Pro Tip: Make sure that when each test case starts, your application is in a well-defined
#          initial state. The test cases above use GoTo with a fixed URL to set the initial
#          application state, but we recommend starting each test case with the dedicated
#          AppState QWord. The test case below starts with AppState Home, where Home is an
#          initial state defined in the Keywords section at the end of the file. More initial
#          states could be defined as needed.

# Pro Tip: In this Keywords section, you could combine QWords to make your own keywords using
#          the structure shown above. The pro way is to define them in a separate file and import
#          that file under Settings.
